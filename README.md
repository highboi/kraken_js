# Tsunami: The Web 3.0 Protocol

![Tsunami Logo](https://github.com/highboi/tsunami/blob/master/tsunami_logo.png)

Tsunami aims to be a web protocol for the new age. Tsunami enables anyone to establish their own "information network" by running an instance of Tsunami on a server called a "beacon".
Beacons allow for connections to be made between peers. After this, peers can manipulate data on the P2P network with a complete CRUD architecture (Create, Read, Update, Destroy).
Tsunami stores primitive data types and files similarly to torrents, fragmenting the data and distributing the data among the peer browsers using the LocalStorage API. Tsunami is
the answer to the problem of big tech, anyone can establish their own information network that scales automatically. Make a custom social network with friends, make a custom cloud
storage solution, make a networked cluster computer, do anything with P2P networks with Tsunami.
