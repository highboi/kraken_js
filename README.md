WebRTC Example:

This repo is for anyone wanting to learn about WebRTC in order to do P2P networking/communication in the browser.
This Proof-of-Concept can be built on to make any peer-to-peer application on the web. The peer-to-peer code defaults
to WebRTC but uses HTTP relay with a socket/relay server if a connection cannot be made if NAT/Firewall issues appear.
